This website has been developed to attempt to assist people with their mentl health challenges by encouraging them to learn a coding skill.
It may be a challenging thing but believing in the fact that the mind always has something it is thinking about, how about using it to develop beautiful things from programming rather than dwelling upon sad memories and thoughts.
This therefore comes in a bid to develop that mindset and with time additional features can be added to it.
Happy coding!
